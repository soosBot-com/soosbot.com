    <h3>Messages</h3>
    <p>
        soosBot's commands work by filtering all messages sent to discord by checking if they start with the prefix from the server.
        If the prefix is detected, then soosBot will parse the contents of the message and run the command provided.

        soosBot's Highlight feature (beta) will work by checking if the messages's guild id is in the database where highlight phrases are stored.
        Then if the phrase is in the message, it will then read 3 or 4 messages around the message and send them to the user that had the highlight active.
    </p>
    <h3>Reactions</h3>
    <p>
        soosBot's Post save feature works by listening to all message reactions and checking if they are the soosBot Save emoji.
        Then if the message contanins a savable post (sent by the meme or post command), it will save the post to the user that reacted's profile.
    </p>

    <h3>Command activity</h3>
    <p>
        soosBot records all command usage in a postgres database. This is so that any activity of spaming, harrasing, or any misuse of soosBot can be recorded.
        Users cannot opt-out of this regardless.
        <br>
        <br>
        * The statisticts command allows users to view this database, but with limited access, as only the top 5 commands used, and the count of them is provided. User's IDs are not shared. 
    </p>

    <h3>
        Opt-out
    </h3>

    <p>
        As of right now, there is no way to opt-out of the message parsing, as it is required for commands to be able to work.
        For the reactions, as there is not demand to oupt-out of them, it is also not available, but if there is any, it will be implmented through a command.
    </p>

    <h3>Other than the uses above, soosBot does not store records or logs of messsages or user activity in any way.</h3>
